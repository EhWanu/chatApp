### ChatApp 

### Description

ChatApp is a messenger application built with React Native and developed using Expo.
ChatApp has been styled using the GiftedChat library to provide a UX that is clean and familiar. Conversations are stored locally as well as being stored on Google Firebase.  You can upload and send pictures too! Only if you have given sufficient permissions of course.
The app allows users to pick and send images from their phone's image library provided the user grants the app permission to access their media library and camera. Users can share their location by enabling the app to read user location data.
